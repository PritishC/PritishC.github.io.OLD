Hi there! This is my new site on the web. The old one can be seen on the Wayback Machine under the same URL.

I will be joining the CSE department at IIT Bombay as a master's research scholar in the fall of 2021. My chosen area is Intelligent Systems, and I am broadly interested in graph mining, graph ML and data science, data mining, and probabilistic graphical models, although these may change as I progress through the program.

Prior to this, I worked as a full-stack software engineer at Instahyre, a recruitment startup whose product matches candidates to jobs in a hassle-free manner and with reasonably high accuracy. I was promoted to Head of Engineering for my contributions and had a great time there in general.

Hi there! This is my new site on the web. The old one can be seen on the Wayback Machine under the same URL.

I am currently enrolled in the Masters by Research program at the CSE department, IIT Bombay. My chosen area is Intelligent Systems, and I am broadly interested in geometric deep learning, graph machine learning, network science and information diffusion. My research advisor is [Prof. Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/).

Prior to this, I worked as a full-stack software engineer at Instahyre, a recruitment startup whose product matches candidates to jobs in a hassle-free manner and with reasonably high accuracy. I was promoted to Head of Engineering for my contributions and had a great time there in general.

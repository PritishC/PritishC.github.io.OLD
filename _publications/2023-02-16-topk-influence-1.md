In this paper, we explore a variant of the influence maximization problem where we wish to reach out to and maximize the probability of infection of a small subset of bounded capacity ùêæ. We show that this problem does not exhibit the same submodular guarantees as the original IM problem, for which we resort to the theory of ùõæ-weakly submodular functions. Subsequently, we develop a greedy algorithm that maximizes our objective despite the lack of submodularity. We also develop a suitable learning model that out-competes baselines on the task of predicting the top-K infected nodes, given a seed set as input.
